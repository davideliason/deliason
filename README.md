## Repo for personal website (v.2.0)
### v.1.0 2015

This site was first started at the beginning of my journey and continues to grow as I learn new tools and concepts.
GitHub Action workflows are what I'm working on right now!

**instructions**
1. $ cd Documents/ folder
2. $ cd deliason/ folderr
3. make any edits to the website data files
4. add, commit, and push edits to the github repositiory
5. There is a Github Action attached to this repo, configured in such a way 
that when a commit pushed to the Github repositiory, those same files (including the changes) are uploaded to the s3 bucket. So, push the commit and refresh the browser and enjoy!
